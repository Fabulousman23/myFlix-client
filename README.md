https://the-great-fabulousman23-site.netlify.app/

##About## This is a database movie app built using the MERN stack technology (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js). Parcel is also used to transpile, minify and organize codebase. The App displays a list of movies fetched from a remote database and allows user interactions such as adding a movie to favorites and dislaying details about movies, their genre and director infos.

## Dependencies

This app uses:

"axios": "^0.27.2",
"parcel": "^2.0.0-rc.0",
"react": "^17.0.2",
"react-bootstrap": "^2.4.0",
"react-dom": "^17.0.2",
"react-redux": "^8.0.2",
"react-router-dom": "5.2.0",
"redux": "^4.2.0",
"redux-devtools-extension": "^2.13.9"

When parcel is run to start the app, it will also install the devDependency @parcel/transformer-sass, as SCSS is used in the app. Additionally, propTypes is used throughout, but does not need to be installed. IMPORTANT: Use the versions listed here or the app will not run.

## The API 
The API is currently stored using MongoDB Atlas, and was created before the app by myself. All data shown in the app is sourced from this API.

Using React to build the client-side for an application called myFlix-client, based on its existing server-side code (REST API and MongoDB). The application is a single-page application (SPA) and uses state routing to navigate between views and sharing URLs.
